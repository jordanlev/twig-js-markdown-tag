# twig-js markdown tag
A `markdown` tag for [twig-js](https://github.com/justjohn/twig.js) that passes through the tag content to the 'marked' parser. It also takes into account the indentation level of the first line of markdown (so the markdown parser doesn't think that every line is a `pre` block).
